# Email Form Submission Fix for OldStreet Whitelist

## Current Status

- The React form in `Whitelist.tsx` correctly submits to `send_whitelist.php`
- The PHP backend processes the form data but the emails are not being delivered
- No error logs or backup emails were found on the server

## Step 1: Fix Identified Issues

1. ✅ Fixed corrupted code at the beginning of `send_whitelist.php`
2. ✅ Added better error logging in both frontend and backend
3. ✅ Created test scripts to isolate PHP and mail function issues

## Step 2: Server Configuration Checks

When you upload these files to your hosting server, check the following:

1. **Verify mail() function availability**:
   - Upload and run `direct_mail_test.php` through your browser
   - Check if the script shows "mail() function exists: YES"
   - Look at "Mail result" to see if PHP can send emails

2. **Check server logs**:
   - Look for `php_errors.log` on your server
   - Ask your hosting provider about mail server logs

## Step 3: Solution Options

### Option 1: Configure server mail() function
If your hosting provider supports PHP's mail() function, ask them to:
- Ensure the mail service is running
- Configure the proper mail relay settings
- Allow outgoing emails from your domain

### Option 2: Use PHPMailer (Recommended)
For more reliable email delivery:

1. Install Composer on your server or locally:
   ```bash
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
   mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
   ```

2. Install PHPMailer:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/website
   composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
   ```

3. Configure PHPMailer:
   - Upload `phpmailer_integration.php` to your server
   - Visit this file in your browser and use the "Generate PHPMailer Version" button
   - Edit the generated file to add your SMTP details:
     - SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com)
     - Username/email
     - Password/app password
   - Replace `send_whitelist.php` with the generated version

### Option 3: Use an Email Service API
If options 1 and 2 don't work, consider:
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Amazon SES
- Any email API service with a PHP SDK

## Step 4: Final Verification

1. Submit a test whitelist form through the actual website interface
2. Check the destination email address (oldstreetnew@oldstreetcm.com)
3. Look for backup files in the `whitelist_emails/` directory
4. Monitor PHP error logs for any issues

## Important Notes

- The form submission works correctly - the issue is with email delivery
- The PHP script already has fallback logic to save emails as files if sending fails
- Always check the PHP error logs if you encounter issues

If you need further assistance with the email configuration, please provide:
1. Your hosting provider name
2. Access to any server logs
3. Results from the test scripts
